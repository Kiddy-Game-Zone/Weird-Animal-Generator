# Weird Animal Generator 🤪🦓🐘🐒

Welcome to the **Weird Animal Generator**! This fun, interactive web game uses a bit of (simulated) AI randomness to combine traits from different animals, creating bizarre and hilarious new creatures. Test your knowledge by guessing the unique name of each generated animal!

## 🎮 About The Game

Ever wondered what a creature with a lion's mane, penguin's body, and a fox's tail would be called? Now you can find out! Our "AI" (a clever randomization engine) dreams up these fantastical beasts, describes their quirky features, and then quizzes you on their newly-minted names. It's a delightful game of imagination and quick wit!

✨ **Get ready for some wild and wacky fun!** ✨
